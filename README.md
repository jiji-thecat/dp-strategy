# Design Pattern - Strategy pattern

## Description

![strategy](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-strategy/assets/104809324/723ad9ad-9178-4ce4-a254-ca339d495dbb)

Strategy pattern is a pattern that will enhance the readibility of the programming code and maintanancity with decuppling the algorithm to another class rather than write them all in one function.

### Class diagram

If you inherit algorithm interface on `ConcreteStrategy` class, then you will be able to reorder the algorithm easily and apperance will look nice.

## How to Install and Run

Import this project as a QT project.

## How to Use This App

This app will compare 2 bowls of beaf and rice. Each button will compare meat, onion and pickles. The bowl which has more ingredents will be displayed. When they are equal, both bowls will be displayed. The algorithm to compare is made by using Strategy pattern.
